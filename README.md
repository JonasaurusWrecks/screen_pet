A tamagotchi-style desktop pet duck

This little guy will hang out on your monitor and keep you company. 
If the happiness levels aren't changed, he'll "get mad" after about a minute. 
Mouse over him (shows a subtle/happy reponse) or doubble click on him (big reaction and plays a quack soundbite) to reset his happy countdown.
My current use for him is to change the happiness level to a higher number (200) and give myself about 20 minutes before he reacts. 
Whenever I take a water break, I inteact with him. If I look up and he's mad, I know I haven't been drinking anough water.
